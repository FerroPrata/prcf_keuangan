# üîî Notification System Fix - Complete Summary

## üìã Issues Identified

### 1. **Duplicate & Wrong Linked Notifications**
- **Problem**: Notifications were fetching proposals and reports separately, then adding them to array sequentially
- **Impact**: Mixed old and new entries, wrong report links showing up
- **Root Cause**: No unified sorting after fetching from multiple sources

### 2. **Not in Chronological Order**
- **Problem**: Each query ordered by DESC, but added to array sequentially (proposals first, then reports)
- **Impact**: A new report created after an old proposal would appear BELOW the old proposal
- **Example**: 
  ```
  Before Fix:
  - Proposal A (2 hours ago)
  - Proposal B (5 hours ago)
  - Report X (1 hour ago)  ‚Üê Should be at top!
  - Report Y (3 hours ago)
  ```

### 3. **10 Second Delay for New Notifications**
- **Problem**: Polling interval was set to 10,000ms (10 seconds)
- **Impact**: Users had to wait up to 10 seconds to see new notifications
- **Root Cause**: Conservative polling frequency

## ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: Unified Timestamp & Sorting

**File**: `api_notifications.php`

**Changes for ALL roles**:
1. Added `notification_time` field to standardize timestamp across all notification types
2. Added `sort_time` field (Unix timestamp) for efficient sorting
3. Implemented `usort()` to sort ALL notifications by time AFTER fetching from all sources
4. Limited to 10 most recent notifications

**Before**:
```php
// Separate queries, no unified sorting
$proposal_notifs = $conn->query("...ORDER BY p.created_at DESC LIMIT 5");
// Add proposals to array
$report_notifs = $conn->query("...ORDER BY lh.created_at DESC LIMIT 5");
// Add reports to array
```

**After**:
```php
// Fetch all with unified timestamp field
$proposal_notifs = $conn->query("SELECT ..., p.created_at as notification_time ...");
while ($row = $proposal_notifs->fetch_assoc()) {
    $notifications[] = [
        ...
        'time' => $row['notification_time'],
        'sort_time' => strtotime($row['notification_time'])
    ];
}

$report_notifs = $conn->query("SELECT ..., lh.updated_at as notification_time ...");
while ($row = $report_notifs->fetch_assoc()) {
    $notifications[] = [
        ...
        'time' => $row['notification_time'],
        'sort_time' => strtotime($row['notification_time'])
    ];
}

// UNIFIED SORTING BY TIME
usort($notifications, function($a, $b) {
    return $b['sort_time'] - $a['sort_time'];
});

// Limit to most recent
$notifications = array_slice($notifications, 0, 10);
```

### Fix 2: Improved Query Filters

#### **Finance Manager**:
- **Proposals**: Show only `status = 'submitted'` (waiting for FM review)
- **Reports**: Show only `status_lap = 'verified' AND (approved_by IS NULL OR approved_by = 0)`
  - Prevents showing reports that FM has already approved

#### **Direktur**:
- **Proposals**: Show `status = 'approved'` within last 30 days (approved by FM)
- **Reports**: Show `approved_by IS NOT NULL` within last 30 days (approved by FM)
  - Extended timeframe from 7 to 30 days for better visibility

#### **Staff Accountant**:
- **Reports**: Show only `status_lap = 'submitted'` (waiting for SA validation)
  - No time filter, shows all pending reports

#### **Project Manager**:
- **Proposals**: Show own proposals with `status = 'approved' OR 'rejected'` within 7 days
- **Reports**: Show own reports with `status_lap IN ('verified', 'approved')` within 7 days
  - Added 'verified' status to notify PM when SA validates their report

---

### Fix 3: Reduced Polling Interval

**File**: `assets/js/realtime_notifications.js`

**Before**:
```javascript
notificationCheckInterval = setInterval(fetchNotifications, 10000); // 10 seconds
```

**After**:
```javascript
notificationCheckInterval = setInterval(fetchNotifications, 3000); // 3 seconds
```

**Benefits**:
- Notifications appear within 3 seconds max (vs 10 seconds before)
- More real-time user experience
- Acceptable server load (1 request per 3 seconds per user)

**Also Added**:
```javascript
// Manual refresh function (for future use with WebSocket/SSE)
function refreshNotifications() {
    fetchNotifications();
}
```

---

### Fix 4: Fixed Badge Count Display

**File**: `assets/js/realtime_notifications.js`

**Before**:
```javascript
countText.textContent = count + ' baru';  // Would show "5 baru baru"
```

**After**:
```javascript
countText.textContent = count;  // Shows just the number, HTML adds "baru"
```

## üîç Technical Details

### Database Queries Optimization

1. **Removed LIMIT from individual queries**: 
   - Old: Each query had `LIMIT 5`
   - New: Fetch all relevant items, then sort and limit to 10 total

2. **Consistent timestamp fields**:
   - Proposals: Use `updated_at` (when status changes)
   - Reports (created): Use `created_at`
   - Reports (approved): Use `updated_at`

3. **Better status filtering**:
   - Prevents duplicate notifications
   - Only shows actionable items per role

## üìä Expected Results

### Chronological Order (Newest First)
```
‚úÖ After Fix:
- Report X (1 hour ago)      ‚Üê Most recent!
- Proposal A (2 hours ago)
- Report Y (3 hours ago)
- Proposal B (5 hours ago)
- Report Z (6 hours ago)
...top 10 most recent only
```

### No Duplicates
- Each report/proposal appears only once
- Correctly filtered by status (no already-processed items)

### Fast Updates
- New notifications appear within 3 seconds
- Badge count updates in real-time
- Proper timestamp display

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### For Finance Manager:
- [ ] Create new proposal as PM ‚Üí Check FM sees it within 3 seconds
- [ ] SA validates report ‚Üí Check FM sees verified report
- [ ] FM approves report ‚Üí Report disappears from FM notifications
- [ ] Check all notifications are in chronological order

### For Direktur:
- [ ] FM approves proposal ‚Üí Check Dir sees it within 3 seconds
- [ ] FM approves report ‚Üí Check Dir sees it
- [ ] Notifications show most recent 30 days only

- [ ] PM creates report ‚Üí Check SA sees it within 3 seconds
- [ ] SA validates report ‚Üí Report disappears from SA notifications
- [ ] Check all pending reports visible

### For Project Manager:
- [ ] FM approves/rejects PM's proposal ‚Üí Check PM sees notification
- [ ] SA validates PM's report ‚Üí Check PM sees notification
- [ ] FM approves PM's report ‚Üí Check PM sees notification
- [ ] Check only last 7 days shown
